# To-do

This repo acts as a planner/to-do list for my projects.

Rules:  
1. Maintain a file (TODO.md) with a list of all projects.  
2. Create a file for each project, summarising it. For example:  
	Contents of **Project1.md**:   
	Are you tired of creatively named projects?  
	Well, Project1 is just the project for you!!
